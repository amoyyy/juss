Specify a custom JSON formatting for a struct `T`. Options include:
    `name`:
    `jsontype`:
    `omitempty`:
    `exclude`:
    `default`:

By default, the JSON input is expected to contain each field of a type and be in the same order as the type was defined. For example, the struct:
```julia
struct T
    a::Int
    b::Int
    c::Union{Nothing, Int}
end
```
Would have JSON like:
```
{"a": 0, "b": 1, "c": null}
{"a": 0, "b": 1, "c": 2}
{"a": 0, "b": 1, "c": null, "d": 3} // extra fields are ignored
{"a": 0} // will work if T(a) constructor is defined
{"a": 0, "b": 1} // will work if T(a, b) constructor is defined
```
That is, each field _must_ be present in the JSON input and match in position to the original struct definition. Extra arguments after the struct's own fieldtypes are ignored.

Again, the default case is for JSON input that will have consistently ordered, always-present fields; for cases where the input JSON is _not_ well-ordered or if there is a possibility of a `null`, non-`Union{T, Nothing}` field, here's how to approach more advanced custom formatting:
    - If the input will always be consistenly-ordered, but fields may be missing (not `null`, but the field key isn't even available in the input), defaults can be provided like:
    ```
    JSON2.@format T begin
        c => (default=0,)
    end
    ```
    This says that, when reading from a JSON input, if field `c` isn't present, to set it's value to 0.

    - If the JSON input is not consistenly-ordered, there are two other options for allowing direct type parsing:

      ```
      T(; a=0, b=0, c=0, kwargs...) = T(a, b, c)
      JSON2.@format T keywordargs begin
        ...
      end
      ```
      Here we've defined a "keywordargs" constructor for `T` that essentially takes a default for each field as keyword arguments, then constructs `T`.
      During parsing, the JSON input will be parsed for any valid field key-values and the keyword constructor will be called
      with whatever arguments are parsed in whatever order. Note that we also included a catchall `kwargs...` in our constructor which can be used to "throw away" or ignore any extra fields in the JSON input.

      ```
      mutable struct T
          a::Int
          b::Int
          c::Union{Nothing, Int}
      end
      T() = T(0, 0, 0)
      JSON2.@format T noargs begin
        ...
      end
      ```
      In this case, we've made `T` a _mutable_ struct and defined a "noargs" constructor `T() = ...`; we then specified in `JSON2.@format T noargs` the `noargs` option.
      During parsing, an instance of `T` will first constructed using the "noargs" constructor, then fields will be set as they're parsed from the JSON input (hence why `mutable struct` is required).
